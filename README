acq400_hapi: acq400 Host API

python module to connect to remote hosts

class Acq400 nails up a socket connection to all the site servers at 4220+s

each knob on the site is presented as a property of the connection, so that 
simple bash-script-like syntax can be used

uut.s0.set_arm=1

The goal is to make it easy to remote-script multiple uut's.

Example:

from acq400_hapi import *
uut1=acq400.Acq400("acq1001_144")
uut2=acq400.Acq400("acq1001_145")

for ii in range(0,10):
	c1 = uut1.s1.SIG_SAMPLE_COUNT_COUNT.split(" ")[1]
	c2 = uut2.s1.SIG_SAMPLE_COUNT_COUNT.split(" ")[1]
	print("%s %s" % (c1, c2))

... and yes, these are EPICS PV's, so we could use capy.
But, this way, it's all vanilla python, no other installs required.

Note also, knob names eg
SIG:SAMPLE_COUNT:COUNT are auto converted to valid python identifiers:
SIG_SAMPLE_COUNT_COUNT



The Acq400 class can be fairly slow to instantiate
(imagine an ACQ2106 with 6 sites populated), but once the connections are 
nailed up, then control links are fast. 
=> The use case is: make the connection at the beginning, then operate over
long periods.

TODO:
- extend socket clients for monitoring
- add socket clients for transient data upload.
- add a 4210 socket for live stream?.
